# This Hyperfoil benchmark runs a GET to the /api/villains/random endpoint
# Here is a list of all the parameters and their default values that can be adjusted when running:
#
# FIGHT_PROTOCOL=http (The protocol used by the benchmark)
# FIGHT_HOST=localhost (The host the rest-villains application is running on)
# FIGHT_PORT=8084 (The port the rest-villains application is running on)
# SHARED_CONNECTIONS=400 (The number of connections to share across the requests)
# USERS_PER_SEC=20 (The number of users per second)
# MAX_SESSIONS=200 (The maximum number of hyperfoil sessions to make available)
# DURATION=3m (The duration to run the benchmark)
