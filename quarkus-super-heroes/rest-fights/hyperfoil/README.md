This directory contains a set of [Hyperfoil](https://hyperfoil.io) benchmarks. An instance of the [`rest-fights`](..) application [**MUST** be running somewhere](../README.md#running-the-application) prior to executing this benchmark.

Each benchmark can be customized via parameters. All the parameters are described in comments at the beginning of each benchmark file.
